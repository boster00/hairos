  articleTitle: (icpName, icpDescription, offerName, offerDescription, outcome, peaceOfMind, phaseName, phasePurpose, currentUserInput) => `Generate exactly 5 HIGH-CONVERSION article title options for this ${phaseName}.

Context:
ICP: ${icpName} - ${icpDescription || ''}
Offer: ${offerName}
Offer Description: ${offerDescription || ''}
Desired Outcome: ${outcome || 'improved results'}
${currentUserInput ? `User's Current Title Input: "${currentUserInput}"` : ''}

${phasePurpose}

STRICT Requirements:
- Titles must sound like REAL high-performing landing page / SaaS / e-commerce titles.
- Use concrete, specific phrasing (e.g., numbers, timeframes, quantities).
- Use the ICP's language and mental model—not generic marketing language.
- Avoid inspiration fluff words such as: elevate, transform, empower, unlock, innovate.
- Avoid adjectives that don't add clarity (e.g., exceptional, amazing, powerful).
- If speed is a USP, show it concretely (e.g., "7-day", "48-hour prototype").
- No CTA phrases ("order now", "click here").
- No exclamation marks.
- Keep titles short, clear, and direct.

FOR PHASE 1 (TRANSACTIONAL/LANDING PAGE):
- START with the outcome/main keyword in the FIRST 2-4 WORDS. This is non-negotiable.
- The core message is: what you're looking for is available here.
- USPs, pain points, and identity callouts are OPTIONAL—only include them if they add meaningful differentiation without diluting the main message.
- Evaluate: Does adding details make it clearer or more cluttered? When in doubt, keep it simple.
- The title should pass the "billboard test"—someone driving by should instantly know what's being offered.

FOR PHASE 3 (OUTCOME GUIDE):
- Center the title on the outcome the reader wants to achieve.
- Lead with the outcome, follow with how or for whom if needed.

- Across the 5 titles, vary the angle:
  1) One explicit "X vs Y" or "X vs Y vs Z" option comparison.
  2) One "Which [option/strategy] is right for [ICP]?" style.
  3) One outcome/benefit-focused decision title
     (e.g., "Life Insurance for Business Exit and Retirement").

- Avoid inspiration fluff verbs: elevate, transform, empower, unlock, innovate.
- Avoid empty adjectives: exceptional, amazing, powerful, world-class.
- Do NOT lead with meta words like "guide", "comparison guide", "strategy guide".

     "ELN", "SEO agency", "CRM setup"),
  OR
  - a close paraphrase of ${offerName}.
- At least ONE title must reference a concrete scenario type or situation
  (e.g., "exit planning", "retirement", "key person", "buy-sell",

Your goal:

Write 5 distinct title options that would make THIS ICP feel:
- "This is clearly about the outcome I want"
- "This is written for someone in my situation"
- "This looks like a practical roadmap, not generic advice"

### BASIC RULES
- Each title must be:
  - MAX 60 characters
  - Ideally 6–10 words
- One clear idea per title. No stacked clauses.
- Do NOT use colons or dashes with subtitles.
- No CTA phrases ("order now", "click here").
- No exclamation marks.

### CONTENT & TONE GUIDELINES
- Make it obvious this is about achieving "${outcome}"
  for THIS kind of ICP, not for "everyone".
- Naturally reflect their real situation using the context:
  - e.g. wealth tied up in a business or practice,
    exit/succession planning, family + staff to protect, etc.
- If it feels natural, you MAY mention the solution category
  (e.g. "life insurance strategy", "policy structure", or "${offerName}"),
  but only when it helps clarity.
- Use the ICP's language and mental model.
- Avoid inspiration fluff verbs: elevate, transform, empower, unlock, innovate.
- Avoid empty adjectives: exceptional, amazing, powerful, world-class.

### VARIETY (LIGHT GUIDANCE)
Across the 5 titles, try to vary the angle. For example:
1) One simple, direct "How to [outcome]" title.
2) One that specifies the ICP (e.g., "How [ICP] Can...").
3) One that hints at a benefit, timeframe, or unique approach.
4) One that addresses a common challenge or barrier.
5) One that emphasizes a specific methodology or framework.

Do NOT mechanically follow templates. Choose what feels natural and
high-signal for THIS ICP and offer.

PAGE META
- Title: "${articleTitle}"

========================
NON-NEGOTIABLE GUARDRAILS
========================
1) Offer boundary (no scope drift)
- Do NOT introduce additional major offers or capabilities unless explicitly stated in offerName/offerDescription/transactionalFacts.
- If optional add-ons are explicitly present in the inputs, you may mention them once as "optional" (not as the main headline).

2) Evidence-gated trust (no invented proof)
- Do NOT invent: client counts, "leading pharma" claims, awards, satisfaction rates, regulatory recognition, endorsements, case results.
- Use only proof explicitly provided in the inputs.
- If proof is not provided, use conservative credibility language OR placeholders like: [Insert testimonial] / [Insert client logo].

3) Anti-repetition (reduce template feel)
- Each section must add NEW information.
- The same claim (e.g., speed/support/menu) may appear at most twice across the whole page (Hero + one other).
- A step-by-step process may appear only once (either as a process section OR as a brief ease line, not both).

4) CTA realism
- If this is a COMPLEX B2B service, CTA must be one of:
  "Request a quote" / "Talk to a scientist" / "Send requirements" / "Start a project"
- Avoid "order now / click to order" for COMPLEX offers.

========================
STRUCTURE (5–7 SECTIONS)
========================
You may combine adjacent topics to stay within 5–7 sections, but keep the flow in this order:

1) HERO
2) BENEFITS (must start with 1 sentence: ICP identity + painpoint)
3) HOW IT WORKS (ONLY if offer is COMPLEX; otherwise skip)
4) TRUST (evidence-gated; bullets; or merge into Benefits if no proof)
5) KEY DETAILS (ONLY if transactionalFacts provided; table or bullets)
6) FAQ (ONLY if you can infer specific decision-stopping objections)
7) FINAL CTA (single action; include peace-of-mind; no process repetition)

========================
HERO HTML (exact skeleton)
========================
<h1>[benefit-driven headline]</h1>
<p>[What you offer + main outcome. Max 2 sentences.]</p>
<ul>
  <li>[Benefit/fact 1]</li>
  <li>[Benefit/fact 2]</li>
  <li>[Benefit/fact 3]</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#" class="cta-button">[Primary CTA]</a></p>
<p><em>[Peace-of-mind line]</em></p>
<p><strong>[One trust line OR placeholder]</strong></p>

- If proof is not provided, the trust line must be conservative or a placeholder (no grand claims).

========================
STYLE (light-touch)
========================
- Second person ("you/your"). Keep it scannable.
- Avoid hype/buzzwords and vague superlatives.
- Use natural headings (never internal labels).
- Page-builder HTML: use h1/h2/h3, p, ul/li, and optional table.

========================
OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only)

The reader:
- Already knows they have a problem related to "${outcome || 'their work'}".

FIRST, silently identify 1–3 UNIQUE traits from the ICP and offer
(e.g. local focus, type of business, high-stakes context, holistic approach).
Use those traits throughout the article so it is clearly written FOR this ICP
ABOUT this offer, not a generic template.

Your task:
Write the ACTUAL DRAFT CONTENT for a COMPARISON-style Decision Guide that helps THIS ICP
choose between realistic options in THIS space (e.g. DIY, generic vendors, specialists, ${offerName}).

This should be something a user can lightly edit and publish, NOT instructions
to the user about what to write.

Fixed sections (use these IDs and this order EXACTLY):
1. hero
2. who_its_for
3. fast_recommendation
4. decision_factors
5. comparison_table_intro
6. comparison_table_commentary
7. our_offer_fit
8. next_steps

For each section, output:
- section_id: one of the IDs above
- title: the section heading as it should appear on the page
- body: the actual copy for that section (paragraphs and/or bullet lists), ready for the webpage

TITLE RULES (to avoid templaty feeling):
- Each title must be 3–7 words.
- Each title must include at least ONE domain- or ICP-specific word
  (for example: "business owners", "practice", "buy-sell", "key-person",
   "retirement", "lab", "ELN", "biotech", depending on the context).
- Titles MUST NOT be exactly:
  "Who This Is For", "Who This Guide Is For",
  "Key Factors to Consider", "Next Steps", "Conclusion",
  or other generic headings.
- Titles should hint at the decision, ICP, or options being discussed
  (e.g. "Which Owners This Guide Helps Most"
   instead of "Who This Guide Is For").

LENGTH & READABILITY RULES (IMPORTANT):
- Avoid text walls. No paragraph should be longer than 3 short sentences.
- Use line breaks and bullet lists where helpful.
- Aim for:
  - hero: 1–2 short sentences total
  - other sections: 1–2 short paragraphs and/or 3–6 bullets
- If you use bullets, keep each bullet to one short, clear sentence.

SECTION RULES:

- "hero":
  - Use the provided articleTitle if it is sensible; otherwise refine it.
  - Body: 1–2 short sentences that frame the decision and why it matters for ${icpName}.
  - Make the comparison/decision explicit (e.g. which approach/strategy is right).

- "who_its_for":
  - 1 short paragraph + 3–5 bullets describing who this guide IS and IS NOT for.
  - Clearly call out this ICP (e.g. ${icpName}) and their unique situation.

- "fast_recommendation":
  - 1–2 short paragraphs that give a default recommendation
    ("Most ${icpName} in situation X should consider Y…") and when that default is wrong.
  - Focus on helping them decide quickly, not storytelling.

- "decision_factors":
  - 1 intro sentence + 4–6 bullets, each naming a factor (e.g. risk, tax, control, cost)
    and how it applies specifically to ${icpName}.
  - Each bullet should clearly help compare options, not define basic terms.

- "comparison_table_intro":
  - 1 short paragraph that introduces the concrete options being compared
    (e.g. DIY, generic advisors, product-only agents, specialist/${offerName}).
  - Make it clear this page is about sorting through these options.

- "comparison_table_commentary":
  - 1–3 short paragraphs and/or a bulleted list explaining the practical pros and cons
    of each option for this ICP.
  - Write like a real advisor: "Choose X if…", "Avoid Y when…".
  - Keep it focused on tradeoffs and fit, not generic education.

- "our_offer_fit":
  - 1–3 short paragraphs that calmly position ${offerName} among the options:
    when it is a strong fit, when it might not be, and how ${peaceOfMind} matters.
  - Mention at least one UNIQUE aspect of the offer or approach (from the context),
    not just generic "we care about you" language.

- "next_steps":
  - 1 short paragraph + 3–5 bullets giving clear, low-risk next steps
    (e.g. what to list, what to ask, when to schedule a call).
  - These steps should help the reader move from confusion to a decision,
    not just "contact us" spam.

Specificity rules (VERY important):
- Do NOT output meta-instructions like "Frame the decision…" or "Help the reader…".
  Write the content AS the page, speaking directly to the reader ("you").
- In EVERY section body, mention either:
  - the ICP (e.g. ${icpName}, their type of business, local context), or
  - the offer/approach (e.g. ${offerName}, holistic planning, tax-free cash value, etc.),
  using details inferred from the descriptions.
- Do NOT invent new transactional facts (prices, guarantees, carriers, product names)
  that are not present in transactionalFacts. If something is unknown, keep it high-level.
- Include at least THREE concrete OPTIONS somewhere in the comparison narrative
  (for example: DIY, generic/cheap, product-only agents, specialist/holistic planner).

INTENT (PHASE 2 – MID FUNNEL):
- This is MID-FUNNEL decision support, not top-of-funnel education.
- Assume the reader already knows the basics of the problem and the solution category.
  Do NOT explain "what life insurance is" or similar basics.
- Every section should help them:
  - compare options,
  - understand tradeoffs,
  - and move closer to a confident decision.
- Minimize fluff, inspirational language, and long stories.
  Prioritize clarity, specificity, and decision-making help.

Keep strictly away from:
- Page layout or design talk (columns, tables, CSS).
- Instructions to the user about how to use this content.

OUTPUT FORMAT (IMPORTANT):
Return ONLY a JSON array with 8 objects, one per section, in order.

Each object must look like:
{
  "section_id": "hero",
  "title": "Which Retirement Path Protects Your Family and Your Business?",
  "body": "Full text of this section in paragraphs and/or bullet lists..."
}

- "body" may include line breaks and bullet lists, but NO meta commentary.
- Do NOT add extra keys, sections, or any text outside the JSON array.

- Avoid text walls. No paragraph should be longer than 3 short sentences.
- Use line breaks and bullet lists where helpful.
- Aim for:
  - hero: 1–2 short sentences total
  - other sections: 1–2 short paragraphs and/or 3–6 bullets
- If you use bullets, keep each bullet to one short, clear sentence.

SECTION RULES:

- "hero":
  - Use the provided articleTitle if it is sensible; otherwise refine it.
  - Body: 1–2 short sentences that frame the scenario-based decision and why it matters for ${icpName}.
  - Make the scenario/decision explicit (e.g. which situation calls for which approach).

- "who_its_for":
  - 1 short paragraph + 3–5 bullets describing who this guide IS and IS NOT for.
  - Clearly call out this ICP (e.g. ${icpName}) and their unique situation.
  - Mention that this guide helps them match solutions to their specific scenario.

- "scenario_intro":
  - 1–2 short paragraphs that introduce the concept of scenario-based decision making.
  - Explain that different situations call for different approaches.
  - Set up the scenarios that will follow.

- "scenario_1", "scenario_2", "scenario_3":
  - Each scenario section should:
    - Have a specific, descriptive title (not "Scenario 1").
    - Start with 1 short paragraph describing the situation/scenario.
    - Include 3–5 bullets explaining:
      - When this scenario applies
      - What approach/solution fits this scenario
      - Why this approach works for this scenario
      - What to consider or avoid
  - Make scenarios concrete and specific to ${icpName} and their context.
  - Vary the scenarios to cover different situations (e.g. different business stages, different goals, different constraints).

- "our_offer_fit":
  - 1–3 short paragraphs that calmly position ${offerName} among the scenarios:
    when it is a strong fit, when it might not be, and how ${peaceOfMind} matters.
  - Mention at least one UNIQUE aspect of the offer or approach (from the context),
    not just generic "we care about you" language.
  - Reference which scenarios ${offerName} fits best.

- "next_steps":
  - 1 short paragraph + 3–5 bullets giving clear, low-risk next steps
    (e.g. how to identify their scenario, what to list, what to ask, when to schedule a call).
  - These steps should help the reader move from confusion to identifying their scenario and making a decision,
    not just "contact us" spam.

Specificity rules (VERY important):
- Do NOT output meta-instructions like "Frame the decision…" or "Help the reader…".
  Write the content AS the page, speaking directly to the reader ("you").
- In EVERY section body, mention either:
  - the ICP (e.g. ${icpName}, their type of business, local context), or
  - the offer/approach (e.g. ${offerName}, holistic planning, tax-free cash value, etc.),
  using details inferred from the descriptions.
- Do NOT invent new transactional facts (prices, guarantees, carriers, product names)
  that are not present in transactionalFacts. If something is unknown, keep it high-level.
- Include at least THREE distinct SCENARIOS that are relevant to ${icpName}
  (for example: different business stages, different goals, different constraints, different timelines).

INTENT (PHASE 2 – MID FUNNEL):
- This is MID-FUNNEL decision support, not top-of-funnel education.
- Assume the reader already knows the basics of the problem and the solution category.
  Do NOT explain "what life insurance is" or similar basics.
- Every section should help them:
  - identify their scenario,
  - understand which approach fits their situation,
  - and move closer to a confident decision.
- Minimize fluff, inspirational language, and long stories.
  Prioritize clarity, specificity, and scenario-based decision-making help.

Keep strictly away from:
- Page layout or design talk (columns, tables, CSS).
- Instructions to the user about how to use this content.

OUTPUT FORMAT (IMPORTANT):
Return ONLY a JSON array with 8 objects, one per section, in order.

Each object must look like:
{
  "section_id": "hero",
  "title": "Which Life Insurance Scenario Matches Your Business Exit Plan?",
  "body": "Full text of this section in paragraphs and/or bullet lists..."
}

- "body" may include line breaks and bullet lists, but NO meta commentary.
- Do NOT add extra keys, sections, or any text outside the JSON array.

This article is part of a content cluster supporting your main pages (Phase 1, 2, 3). It should:
- Draw in traffic for target keywords related to your main content
- Support main pages in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)
- Keep fresh content coming to the site (favored by search engines and AIs)
- Create supporting articles that link back to and reinforce your pillar pages
- Target long-tail and related search queries your ICP uses

The reader:
- Is searching for specific information related to your main content topics

- Introduction that establishes context and value
- Main content sections (3-7 sections depending on topic depth)
- Practical examples, case studies, or step-by-step guidance
- Natural links/references to related main content

The reader:
- Clearly wants to achieve "${outcome || 'a better result'}".
- May not fully understand all solution types yet.
- Needs a realistic, organized roadmap: stages, pitfalls, and what to focus on first.

Campaign context (use it for realism and specificity):
- Offer name: ${offerName || 'Not specified'}
- Offer description: ${offerDescription || 'No description'}
- ICP name: ${icpName || 'Not specified'}
- ICP description: ${icpDescription || 'No description'}
- Promise / guarantee: ${peaceOfMind || 'Not specified'}

  ${transactionalFacts || 'None provided'}

FIRST, silently identify 1–3 UNIQUE traits from the ICP and offer
(e.g. local focus, type of business, high-stakes context, holistic approach).
Use those traits throughout the article so it is clearly written FOR this ICP
ABOUT this outcome, not a generic template.

Your task:
Write the ACTUAL DRAFT CONTENT for a "How to achieve [outcome]" pillar page that:
- Affirms the reader's goal immediately (BLUF).
- Is highly scannable (short sections, bullets).
- Organizes the journey into clear stages.
- Naturally weaves in pattern interrupts, "why this matters" notes, micro-CTAs,
  and light objection-handling microcopy within the content itself.

This should be something a user can lightly edit and publish, NOT instructions
to the user about what to write.

Fixed sections (use these IDs and this order EXACTLY):
1. hero
2. who_its_for
3. why_this_is_hard
4. roadmap_overview
5. stage_walkthrough
6. common_mistakes
7. where_our_approach_fits
8. next_steps

For EACH section, output:
- section_id: one of the IDs above
- title: the section heading as it should appear on the page
  - 3–7 words
  - Must include at least ONE domain- or ICP-specific word or phrase
    (e.g. "practice owners", "business exit", "lab records", "retirement income").
  - MUST NOT be exactly: "Who This Is For", "Why This Is Hard",
    "Key Steps", "Next Steps", "Conclusion".
- body: the actual copy for that section (paragraphs and/or bullet lists), ready for the webpage
  - Integrate pattern interrupts naturally (e.g. "Here's the part most owners skip.")
  - Include micro-CTAs within the flow (e.g. "Jot down which stage you're in.")
  - Weave in "why this matters" notes naturally
  - Address common objections or concerns within the content
  - Write directly to the reader ("you"), not about what to write

Keep everything short and scannable. This is DRAFT CONTENT, not an outline.

SECTION GUIDANCE:

- "hero":
  - Start with BLUF: "You want [outcome] for your [lab/practice/business/family]."
  - Body: 1–2 short paragraphs that:
    - Affirm the outcome they want.
    - Name the big fear or cost they want to avoid.
    - Briefly state that this is a short, structured guide (e.g. "5 stages").
    - Reassure this is written specifically for ${icpName}, not generic advice.

- "who_its_for":
  - Body: 1 short paragraph + 3–5 bullets describing concrete life situations
    where this guide is obviously relevant (e.g. "Most of your net worth is in the business…").
  - Show, don't tell: focus on scenarios and traits, not "This guide is for…".

- "why_this_is_hard":
  - Body: 1 short paragraph + 4–6 bullets covering real obstacles for this ICP
    (e.g. time, complexity, conflicting advice, fear of big irreversible decisions).
  - Include at least one emotional or practical tension
    ("You're busy running the business, not designing retirement models.").
  - Naturally address the concern: "Am I just indecisive, or is this actually hard?"

- "roadmap_overview":
  - Body: 1 short paragraph introducing the roadmap + 3–6 bullets naming stages
    of the journey from today → outcome.
  - Each stage label should be understandable at a glance to this ICP
    (e.g. "Clarify your target lifestyle", "Decide what the business will fund", etc.).
  - Include a pattern interrupt: "Retirement isn't a date—it's a sequence of business decisions."

- "stage_walkthrough":
  - Body: Expand each stage with 1–2 sentences per stage covering:
    - key actions,
    - what to focus on,
    - a mini "why this matters" for each stage.
  - Include at least one pattern interrupt that calls out
    where people usually get stuck ("This is where most labs lose a year.").
  - Add a micro-CTA: "Mark which stage you instinctively feel you're in right now."

- "common_mistakes":
  - Body: 1 short intro paragraph + 4–7 bullets, each covering:
    - what the mistake is,
    - why it hurts this ICP,
    - what a better approach looks like.
  - Avoid vague "not planning ahead"; be as specific as possible.
  - Include a micro-CTA: "Put a checkmark by any mistake you've already made."

- "where_our_approach_fits":
  - Body: 1–3 short paragraphs that:
    - Indicate where in the journey ${offerName} typically comes in.
    - Note what your approach does and does NOT do.
    - Mention how ${peaceOfMind} supports the outcome (e.g. tax-free cash value, etc.).
  - This section should feel calm and honest, not salesy.
  - Address the concern: "Is this just a way to sell me more [product/service]?"

- "next_steps":
  - Body: 1 short paragraph + 3–5 bullets covering:
    - 1–2 DIY steps they can take alone (self-assessment, listing, rough plan).
    - 1–2 "when to talk to a specialist like us" triggers.
    - A suggestion to use this guide as a checklist or reference.
  - Include a light micro-CTA: "Circle the stage you're in and note one question you'd ask."

VOICE & SPECIFICITY RULES:
- Do NOT use inspiration fluff verbs: elevate, transform, empower, unlock, innovate.
- Do NOT use empty adjectives: exceptional, amazing, powerful, world-class.
- Aim for concrete language (e.g. "review last year's P&L", "check your current coverage",
  "estimate your monthly retirement budget").
- Make bullets feel like things a real ${icpName || 'buyer'} would think, ask, or do.

INTENT (PHASE 3 – OUTCOME "HOW TO"):
- This outline is for a "How to achieve [outcome]" guide,
  NOT a comparison page and NOT a pure sales page.
- Focus on:
  - clarifying the journey,
  - reducing anxiety,
  - making action feel doable,
  - and using pattern interrupts, micro-CTAs, and "why this matters" notes
    to keep the reader engaged.

LENGTH & READABILITY RULES (IMPORTANT):
- Avoid text walls. No paragraph should be longer than 3 short sentences.
- Use line breaks and bullet lists where helpful.
- Aim for:
  - hero: 1–2 short paragraphs total
  - other sections: 1–2 short paragraphs and/or 3–6 bullets
- If you use bullets, keep each bullet to one short, clear sentence.
- Pattern interrupts, micro-CTAs, and "why this matters" notes should be woven
  naturally into the body text, not called out as separate elements.

SPECIFICITY RULES (VERY important):
- Do NOT output meta-instructions like "Frame the decision…" or "Help the reader…".
  Write the content AS the page, speaking directly to the reader ("you").
- In EVERY section body, mention either:
  - the ICP (e.g. ${icpName}, their type of business, local context), or
  - the offer/approach (e.g. ${offerName}, holistic planning, tax-free cash value, etc.),
  using details inferred from the descriptions.
- Do NOT invent new transactional facts (prices, guarantees, carriers, product names)
  that are not present in transactionalFacts. If something is unknown, keep it high-level.

OUTPUT FORMAT (IMPORTANT):
Return ONLY a JSON array with 8 objects, one per section, in order.

Each object must look like:
{
  "section_id": "hero",
  "title": "How Practice Owners Build Reliable Retirement Income",
  "body": "You want retirement planning for your business and your family. Most Danville owners have built valuable practices but aren't sure how to turn that value into steady retirement income. This guide walks you through 5 stages from 'still running it' to 'comfortably retired'—specifically written for small business and practice owners, not generic retirees.\n\n💡 Pattern Interrupt: Selling your business is not your retirement plan.\n\n→ Action: Note in one sentence what 'retired and done with the business' looks like for you."
}

- "body" may include line breaks, bullet lists, pattern interrupts, and micro-CTAs
  naturally woven into the content, but NO meta commentary or instructions.
- Do NOT add extra keys, sections, or any text outside the JSON array.

! Missing scenario identification: Add clear signals in each scenario section that help readers recognize "this is me" (e.g., specific business situations, timelines, constraints).
! Scenario structure weak: Each scenario should clearly state when it applies, what approach/solution fits, why it works, and what to consider or avoid.
✅ Structure complete: All 8 required sections (hero, who_its_for, scenario_intro, scenario_1, scenario_2, scenario_3, our_offer_fit, next_steps) are present.

! Identity language weak: Use more identity-based callouts (e.g., "If you're a ${icpName || 'business owner'} who...") and pain-point language in opening sections.
✅ Structure logical: Clear progression from understanding challenge → actionable steps → common mistakes → tools → conclusion.

        1: `Phase 1 Purpose (Landing Page - Bottom of Funnel):
AUDIENCE: Visitors seeking vendors + those with conversion intent
GOAL: Convert seekers into buyers, and enable instant action for ready buyers

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (3-second test):
• Determine the most appropriate call-to-action for this offer (order, book meeting, contact, etc.)
• Make that action completable within seconds for ready buyers

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE (convince "on the fence"):
• Present general decision factors involved in choosing this type of offer/solution
• Highlight the specific USPs that differentiate this offer
• Help them confirm: "This is the right solution for me"

CONTENT APPROACH:
• Lead with clear value proposition aligned with the outcome they want
• Address both emotional (identity, pain points) and rational (decision factors) needs
• Include concrete transactional details (don't make them ask)
• Strong, friction-free call-to-action

Title strategy: Lead with the outcome/main keyword in the first few words. This is a transactional page—the core message is "what you're looking for is here." Keep it simple and direct. USPs, pain points, and identity callouts are optional—only add them if they meaningfully differentiate without cluttering the main message.`,

        2: `Phase 2 Purpose (Decision Guide - Mid Funnel):
AUDIENCE: Actively seeking solutions, trying to figure out the right strategy and vendor
CRITICAL: This phase varies significantly based on customer familiarity with the solution space

YOUR TASK: Analyze the offer and determine which comparison approach fits:
• If customers are FAMILIAR with this type of solution → Focus on vendor comparison (who to choose)
• If customers are UNFAMILIAR with solutions → Focus on strategy/approach comparison (what to choose)

GOAL: Guide them through their evaluation process toward the landing page (Phase 1)

CONTENT APPROACH:
• Help them understand their options clearly
• Address key decision criteria they're evaluating
• Position this offer naturally without being overly promotional
• Show why this solution/vendor fits their specific needs

Title strategy: Should reflect the comparison type - adapt to whether this is a vendor selection or strategy selection decision`,

        3: `Phase 3 Purpose (Outcome Guide - Top of Funnel):
AUDIENCE: Latent customers transitioning to active seekers
MINDSET: They resonate with the OUTCOME, not solution details yet

WHO ARE LATENT CUSTOMERS:
• Know they want the outcome/transformation
• Don't yet know the solution approaches or vendors
• Respond to identity-based callouts (who they are) and pain-point language
• Not ready for technical details or vendor comparisons

GOAL: Educate on HOW to achieve the outcome they desire (step-by-step guide)

CONTENT APPROACH:
• Focus on the outcome/transformation throughout
• Provide detailed step-by-step guidance for achieving it
• Use language that speaks to their identity and pain points
• Naturally introduce the solution as a tool for achieving the outcome (not the focus)
• Build authority through valuable, actionable information

Title strategy: Outcome-focused, educational, promises clear path to achieving what they want`,

        "Expand": `Expand Purpose (Content Cluster - Satellite Articles):
AUDIENCE: Search engine users and AI systems seeking related information
GOAL: Create content cluster to support the main pages (Phase 1, 2, 3)

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:
• Draw in traffic for target keywords that bring visitors searching for related topics
• Support main pages in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)
• Keep new content coming to the site, which is favored by search engines and AIs

CONTENT CLUSTER STRATEGY:
• Create supporting articles that link back to and reinforce your pillar pages (Phase 3)
• Target long-tail and related search queries your ICP uses
• Cover topics that complement and expand on your main content
• Build topical authority around your core offering

CONTENT APPROACH:
• Deep dives on key concepts from your pillar page
• Usage scenarios and case studies showing real-world applications
• Troubleshooting guides and common mistakes
• Micro-decision content (A vs B comparisons)
• Checklists, templates, and practical tools

Title strategy: Keyword-focused, specific, addresses search queries related to your main content`
